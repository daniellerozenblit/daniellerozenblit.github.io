                <li><h3>AMD CPU Error Telemetry Dashboard</h3><br>Created a telemetry dashboard for the AMD platform to monitor processor errors in the AMD product lines. Utilized Azure Data Explorer / Kusto in order to decode telemetry information from SEL and WHEA logs and extract relevant data. Utilized Microsoft Power BI in order to provide effective and intuitive vizualizations of error trends that could reveal error dependencies. This dashboard was effectively used by the team to identify, escalate, and remidiate a particular firmware issue with AMD Milan based systems.</li>
                <li><h3>DRAM Test and Repair</h3><br>Developed a DRAM Test and Repair (DTR) feature for AMD platforms that would provide instant, remote, and in-system DRAM cell replacement for Azure infrastructure. This feature utlizes a Memory Built-in Self-Test (BIST) and the Post Package Repair algorithm (PPR) in order to perform and report telemetry for in-system DIMM repairs. Has huge potential business impact for Azure - eliminates DIMM replacement costs and reduce server out of service times from several weeks to around 40 minutes for DIMM repairs. </li>
